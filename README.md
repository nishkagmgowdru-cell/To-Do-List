# To-Do-List
In this assignment, you will design and implement a to-do list application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The application should provide a user-friendly interface and should be responsive to different screen sizes.
This is a To-Do List App. It helps you remember things you need to do.
You can write a task, like:
•“Drink water”
•“Do workout”
•“Arrange your cupboard”
And the app will keep track of them for you.
You can add, edit, delete, or mark tasks as done. Even if you close the app or refresh the page, your tasks will stay saved.
